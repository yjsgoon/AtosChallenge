        “I’m” is a new paradigm to switch corporation driven personal data
        management environment to user driven personal data management environment.
        \n\t
        First of all,“I’m” encapsulates personal data and encode before saving in the user’s
        mobile device. Also, “I’m” can become the bridge of trust between the company and the
        users. Lastly, the company requests the data they need through this bridge, and the user
        is the last one to approve.
        \n\t
        Through this, consumer and the company would trust each other, and furthermore
        it makes clean personal data ecosystem. </string>
